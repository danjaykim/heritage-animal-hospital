                At Heritage Animal Hospital, our mission is simple yet profound:
                to provide compassionate, high-quality veterinary care that
                strengthens the bond between pets and their families.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light mb-2 md:text-center md:w-[75%] lg:w-1/2">
                We believe that every animal deserves exceptional medical
                attention in a warm, welcoming environment. Guided by
                professionalism and expertise, our team is dedicated to ensuring
                the well-being of every patient, from routine wellness visits to
                advanced medical care.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light md:text-center md:w-[75%] lg:w-1/2">
                Through client education, state-of-the-art treatments, and a
                commitment to personalized care, we strive to empower pet owners
                and enhance the lives of the animals they love. Our goal is to
                be more than a veterinary clinic â€” we aim to be a trusted
                partner in your pet&apos;s lifelong health and happiness.
